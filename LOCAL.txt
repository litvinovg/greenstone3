For developers:

To help with configuring your environment to compile up the source code,
you can set up a 'local' folder with the necessary setup/devel files.

For example, for 64-bit linux (in your top-level Greenstone3 folder):

  svn co http://svn.greenstone.org/local/greenstone3/linux-64bit local

Then edit:

  local/gs3-{setup,devel}.sh

accordingly.
