 On Windows, p.destroy() terminates process p that Java launched,
 but does not terminate any processes that p may have launched. Presumably since they didn't form a proper process tree.

 Not possible: stackoverflow.com/questions/1835885/send-ctrl-c-to-process-open-by-java 
 But can use taskkill or tskill or wmic commands to terminate a process by processID
 stackoverflow.com/questions/912889/how-to-send-interrupt-key-sequence-to-a-java-process
 Taskkill command can kill by Image Name, such as all running perl, e.g. taskkill /f /im perl.exe
 But what if we kill perl instances not launched by GS?
    /f Specifies to forcefully terminate the process(es). We need this flag switched on to kill childprocesses.
    /t Terminates the specified process and any child processes which were started by it. 
			/t didn't work to terminate subprocesses. Maybe since the process wasn't launched as 
			a properly constructed processtree.
    /im is the image name (the name of the program), see Image Name column in Win Task Manager.
	
 We don't want to kill all perl running processes. 
 Another option is to use wmic, available since Windows XP, to kill a process based on its command
 which we sort of know (SafeProcess.command) and which can be seen in TaskManager under the 
 "Command Line" column of the Processes tab.
    https://superuser.com/questions/52159/kill-a-process-with-a-specific-command-line-from-command-line	
 The following works kill any Command Line that matches -site localsite lucene-jdbm-demo
    C:>wmic PATH win32_process Where "CommandLine like '%-site%localsite%%lucene-jdbm-demo%'" Call Terminate
 "WMIC Wildcard Search using 'like' and %"
    https://codeslammer.wordpress.com/2009/02/21/wmic-wildcard-search-using-like-and/
 However, we're not even guaranteed that every perl command GS launches will contain the collection name
 Nor do we want to kill all perl processes that GS launches with bin\windows\perl\bin\perl, though this works:
    wmic PATH win32_process Where "CommandLine like '%bin%windows%perl%bin%perl%'" Call Terminate
 The above could kill GS perl processes we don't intend to terminate, as they're not spawned by the particular
 Process we're trying to terminate from the root down.
	
 Solution: We can use taskkill or the longstanding tskill or wmic to kill a process by ID. Since we can
 kill an external process that SafeProcess launched OK, and only have trouble killing any child processes
 it launched, we need to know the pids of the child processes. 
 
 We can use Windows' wmic to discover the childpids of a process whose id we know.
 And we can use JNA to get the process ID of the external process that SafeProcess launched.
 
 To find the processID of the process launched by SafeProcess,
 need to use Java Native Access (JNA) jars, available jna.jar and jna-platform.jar.
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4750470/how-to-get-pid-of-process-ive-just-started-within-java-program
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35842/how-can-a-java-program-get-its-own-process-id
    http://www.golesny.de/p/code/javagetpid
    https://github.com/java-native-access/jna/blob/master/www/GettingStarted.md
 We're using JNA v 4.1.0, https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/net.java.dev.jna/jna
  
 WMIC can show us a list of parent process id and process id of running processes, and then we can
 kill those child processes with a specific process id.
    https://superuser.com/questions/851692/track-which-program-launches-a-certain-process
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7486717/finding-parent-process-id-on-windows
 WMIC can get us the pids of all childprocesses launched by parent process denoted by parent pid.
 And vice versa:
    if you know the parent pid and want to know all the pids of the child processes spawned:
        wmic process where (parentprocessid=596) get processid
    if you know a child process id and want to know the parent's id:
        wmic process where (processid=180) get parentprocessid
 
 The above is the current solution.
 
 Eventually, instead of running a windows command to kill the process ourselves, consider changing over to use
    https://github.com/flapdoodle-oss/de.flapdoodle.embed.process/blob/master/src/main/java/de/flapdoodle/embed/process/runtime/Processes.java 
 (works with Apache license, http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
 This is a Java class that uses JNA to terminate processes. It also has the getProcessID() method. 
 
 Linux ps equivalent on Windows is "tasklist", see
