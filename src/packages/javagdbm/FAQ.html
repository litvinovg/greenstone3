<h3>Is this a JDBC driver?</h3>

<p>(Alain Magloire)

<p>No. JDBC seems mainly intended for interfaces to relational
databases, and GDBM is not a relational database. 

<p>However, JDBC does permit use of a subset to interface to
non-relational databases.  Implementing this might be interesting: let
me know if it's useful to you.

<h3>Does JavaGDBM understand SQL?</h3>

<p>(Alain Magloire)

<p>No, JavaGDBM is intended to store on-disk hash tables.  They solve
a different class of problem to that appropriate for SQL and
relational databases.

<h3>What type of database should I use?</h3>

<p>Broadly, options for data storage in Java include

<ul>
<li>A hash file through JavaGDBM.
<li>A relational database through JDBC
<li>An object-oriented database
<li>Serialization to a file
</ul>

<p>Make sure you choose the right tools: there is no single `best' answer.

<h3>Are you maintaining GDBM?</h3>

<p>No.  I understand that GDBM is still maintained by the FSF.

<h3>Does it work on NT?</h3>

<p>It should, but I haven't tried it.  You'll need a C compiler to
build the native library.  Let me know if you try.

<h3>Why does the test harness report exceptions</h3>

<p>The test harness may report messages such as

<pre>
caught: au.com.pharos.gdbm.GdbmException: File open error: No such file or
directory? (gdbmjava.c:101)
</pre>

<p>These are expected exceptions: the test harness is making sure that
exceptions are thrown when they should be.

<h3>I was trying to compile the Java GDBM distribution and it says gdbm.h not found</h3>

<p>(Sandeep Kumar)

<ol>
<li>Make sure you have the GDBM library installed on your system.  
If the library is not installed, you should be able to find it at 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/">www.gnu.org</a>

<li>Make sure your compiler is configured to find the libraries and
include files.

</ol>

<h3><tt>GdbmFile.h</tt> is missing</h3>

<p>(Paul Matthews)

<p><tt>GdbmFile.h</tt> is build by <tt>javah</tt> when the library is
built.

<h3>What is the best source to learn Java?</h3>

<p>(Celil Germeyan)

<p>Personally, I recommend the excellent Java series of books from
<a href="http://www.ora.com/info/java/bibliography.html/">O'Reilly and
Associates</a> and the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/index.html">Javasoft/Addison
Wesley</a> books.

<h3>I get a `not ok 40' message running the test</h3>

<p>(Steve Waldman)

<p>If you find a bug, either have a look at the code yourself, or
send e-mail to 
<a href="mailto:mbp@pharos.com.au"><tt>mbp@pharos.com.au</tt></a>.  
There's no warranty on JavaGDBM, but I will try to respond to your
mail and problem.

<h3>I get linker errors on Solaris</h3>

<p>(Alex Soto)

Hi,

    I'm hoping to use your JavaGDBM api for my application, but I'm
having some problems compiling the libgdbmjava.so.  Here is a partial
listing of the errors:

gcc -o libgdbmjava.so -shared gdbmjava.o -lgdbm
Text relocation remains                       referenced
    against symbol                  offset      in file
free                                0x258
/usr/local/lib/libgdbm.a(gdbmreorg.o)
free                                0xd0
/usr/local/lib/libgdbm.a(gdbmclose.o)
free                                0xb8
/usr/local/lib/libgdbm.a(gdbmclose.o)
free                                0x218
[snipped]

I have used the libgdbm.a lib before, and don't believe there is a
problem with it.  I'm compiling to Solaris 2.6, using JDK 1.1.4.
</pre>

<p>The solution turned out to be that the gdbm native library
must be compiled with the <tt>-fpic</tt> flag to cause the compiler to
generate position-independant code.  

<h3>What happens if a reader tries to open the database while a writer is doing something?</h3>

<p>(Rich Neill)

<p>Access will be denied until the writer releases its lock.  

<p>JavaGDBM uses a shared-read/exclusive-write protocol at the OS
level.  However, multiple Java threads can access a file concurrently.

<h3>What platforms does JavaGDBM run on?</H3>

<p>It should run on any platform that supports JDK1.1 or higher, JNI
(Java Native Interface), and GDBM.  JavaGDBM is known to run on 

<ul>
<li>Linux/i386
<li>Solaris/SPARC and Solaris/i86
<li>AIX 4
</ul>

<p>If you have any information on other platforms, please let me know.

<h3>You don't anticipate going Pure Java soon, do you?</h3>

<p>(Brian Thorstad)

<p>It's on the `long-term' TODO list.  I'd like to do it, but don't have
any date in mind.

and other software used in building JavaGDBM.
