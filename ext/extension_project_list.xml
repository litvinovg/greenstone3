		<description>The quality of metadata in a digital library is an important factor in ensuring access for end-users.  As collections grow in size maintaining quality through manual methods becomes increasingly difficult for repository managers. The tool is built as an extension to the Greenstone3 digital library software.
		
This extension requires Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.4 or higher. If you do do have JDK installed on your computer, you can download it from Sun (http://java.sun.com/).
