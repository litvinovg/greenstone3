#### properties file for Greenstone3 building using ANT. See the README for more 
#### information

## Tomcat installation
# Set this to the internet/intranet name of the machine that Tomcat is/will be 
# run on. localhost is fine for accessing the server from the local machine, 
# but not remotely
tomcat.server=localhost
# The port number that tomcat is/will be run on
tomcat.port=8383
# Tomcat's shutdown port - this may need to be changed if you are running two or more Tomcats
tomcat.shutdown.port=8305
# If tomcat is already running, enter the path to the base directory here
tomcat.installed.path=
# uncomment the following if you have moved the greenstone3 web directory to tomcats webapps dir 
#web.home=${tomcat.installed.path}/webapps/greenstone3

## If creating a GS3 set up with a dispersed web folder ("web-dispersed" GS3), with GS3 in a read-only location, then 
## it will need a distinct user web folder for content (sites and collections), and need to run tomcat from TMP.
## You need to configure 4 properties to get a "web-dispersed" GS3 to work on windows:
## - set web.home above to the writable location where collections and sites should be created (use forward slashes)
## - uncomment using.user.web below and set to true, 
## To make tomcat run from TMP folder (a writable location):
## - set gsdl3home.isreadonly to true and 
## - set gsdl3.writablehome to ${java.io.tmpdir}/greenstone/web (use forward slashes)
# using.user.web=true

# Default derby networked server portnumber is 1527, can change this here in case of conflict
derby.server.port=1527
# The following is best left as it is, except if 'localhost' doesn't work on your machine,
# then try setting it to 127.0.0.1 or its IPv6 equivalent 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
derby.server=localhost

## Collection building options
# uncomment if you don't want to have collection building enabled
#disable.collection.building=true
#
# uncomment (and edit) if you want to control where perl is found
#perl.path=/usr/bin

## Greenstone 3 server program options
# does running the server automatically start up Tomcat and a browser
server.auto.start=false
# if set to true, won't try other ports if the specified port is not available
server.keep.port=false
# default servlet to start with
server.default.servlet=/library
# whether to make the greenstone pages publicly accessible or only to this machine
server.external.access=true

# The context name of your GS3 digital library. By default this will be "greenstone3". 
# Ensure this has a value. If you change this multiple times, you need to remove the old versions
# of <custom.context>.xml from GS3/packages/tomcat/conf/Catalina/localhost
# does not contain previous 
custom.context=greenstone3

##Browser setup
browser.path=

## Proxy setup - Greenstone installation will attempt to download extra packages. Set the proxy information here if you are behind a firewall.
# The proxy server name 
proxy.host=
# The proxy server port
proxy.port=
# A user name to use when talking to the proxy server (optional, will prompt if not entered here)
proxy.user=
# A password to use when talking to the proxy server (optional, will prompt if not entered here)
proxy.password=

## java compilation properties - for javac
# Should compilation include the debug option?
compile.debug=true
# Should compilation include the deprecation option?
compile.deprecation=true
# Should compilation include the optimize option?
compile.optimize=true

# Properties that control cross-compiling
compile.cross        = false
#cross.os             = windows
#cross.host           = i686-w64-mingw32
#cross.build          = i686-pc-linux-gnu
#cross.configure.extraargs =

#cross.os             = android
#cross.host           = arm-linux-androideabi
#cross.build          = i686-pc-linux-gnu
#cross.configure.extraargs = gl_cv_header_working_stdint_h=yes


# Control whether or not JNI bindings are used
#   e.g. MG, MG++ and GDBM and the like
# Setting this false means these components are not available to the install
# The expectation is that collections will be build from 100% Java components:
#   e.g Lucene and JDBM
# 
# Ant 1.7.1 and before only test for *existence* so this needs to be commented
# in or out to control whether jni is used or not
with.jni=true

## Controls whether or not we want GLI and GEMS to be checked out and compiled
with.gli.and.gems=true

## Control if compilation of gs2 is static or not. Used, for example, for distributions
# Same issue as 'with.jni' for how this gets used in ant 1.7.1 and before
#compile.static=true

# A flag used by the release-kit to compile with gnomelib
# (Previously this flag was called use.support.lib but got conflated with
# the property checkout.gnomelib.ext below)
#use.gnomelib.ext=true

## Uncomment these lines if enabling compilation with the gnome-lib extension
## and if compiling imagemagick
## These extensions should be in the [gsdl3home]/gs2build/ext directory
#checkout.gnomelib.ext=true
#checkout.imagemagick.ext=true

# By default, GS3 will check out the pdfbox extension from SVN
checkout.pdfbox.ext=true

# The following two properties are automatically overridden by gs3-server
# when running off a read-only medium such as a DVD ...
#
# The 'writable' home default is to be the same location as gsdl3.home
gsdl3home.isreadonly=false
gsdl3.writablehome=${basedir}/web

# ... alternative the above can be changed to
#
#  gsdl3home.isreadonly=true
#  gsdl3.writablehome=${java.io.tmpdir}/greenstone/web
#
# ... or else provided on the command line, e.g.:
#   ant -Dgsdl3home.isreadonly=true gsdl3.writablehome=/tmp/greenstone/web start

## windows c++ compilation
# The following property does not help in build.xml. 
# The user needs to run Visual Studio's vcvars32.bat script from the
# MSDOS prompt before compiling Greenstone3 (before "ant prepare install")
#compile.windows.c++.setup=C:/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio/VC98/Bin/VCVARS32.BAT

##Flax stuff##
##uncomment if you want to install flax
#install.flax=true
flax.checkout.path=${flax.svn.root}/trunk/flaxmain

##These need to be uncommented if using Fedora and Fedora GSearch with Greenstone's tomcat
fedora.home=#${basedir}/ext/fedora3
#fedora.maxpermsize=-XX:MaxPermSize=128m
#fedora.password=pounamu
#index.writelock.timeout=10000

##Web services related constants##
base.webservice.name=SOAPServer
##listing and description of all the web services deployable on GS3##
web.services.list=${base.webservice.name} for Greenstone3's core web services, QBR${base.webservice.name} for Query, Browse and Retrieve services
